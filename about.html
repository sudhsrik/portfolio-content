		<h1>Sudharsan Babu Srikanthan</h1>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			The field of Networking and Communications has evolved greatly in recent years fueled by
			advances in Telecommunications, Artificial Intelligence and perfect interplay between complex
			hardware and software. This dynamic and pervasive field has always aroused my fascination
			and has inculcated in me an insatiable desire to learn more. My undergraduate education in
			Electronics and Communication Engineering gave me an opportunity to obtain a glimpse of
			the extensive research prospects in this area and motivated me to pursue a MS program in
			Electrical and Computer Engineering focused on Networking and Communications. This
			interest is due to the projects and coursework I did as a part of my curriculum.
		</p>
		<p>
			The emphasis given to hands on learning and the close collaboration between science and
			engineering greatly influenced my decision to pursue a Masters in ECE at UM. After this
			program, I plan to join the RnD department of a prominent communication company like
			Qualcomm, Cisco, etc. and work on research projects that will advance the state of the art in
			communications and networking. Considering the huge emphasis given to research and
			innovation, I am confident that this program would go a long way in furthering my career and
			helping me achieve these goals.
