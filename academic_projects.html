                        <h3> Secured Electronic Voting System Using the Concepts of Blockchain (Python, multithreading, TCP/IP, UDP, socket programming)                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            During my third semester, we developed a novel blockchain algorithm using python to
                            maintain the integrity of the voting data stored in an electronic voting system. In contrast to
                            existing algorithms that involve token transfer between nodes during a transaction, our model
                            stored the vote data inside the transactions itself. We developed our code from scratch
                            instead of reusing architectures from Ethereum and Bitcoin as our algorithm was unique. By
                            learning the concepts from the fundamental principles, we were able to effectively identify the
                            strengths and weaknesses of this technology. This enabled us to devise novel strategies to
                            enhance the efficacy and adequately compensate for the shortcomings of this technology. We
                            presented our results in a research paper at an IEEE international conference. This
                            experience taught me to reason from first principles.

                        <h3> Prefetching and edge caching for CDNs </h3>
                        <p>
                            As a summer intern at IIT, Guwahati, I worked to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) for the
                            end-user in DASH video streaming by implementing prefetching in Content Delivery Networks
                            (CDN). The implementation was done in CDNsim, a simulator with a C++ backend that runs
                            on top of the OMNet++ framework. Based on the predicted future data rate between the
                            mobile device and base station, the appropriate encoded alternative of the subsequent video
                            chunk was fetched in advance from the origin server and cached in the CDN. This increased
                            the cache hit ratio and improved QoS for the end-user by minimizing buffering. Since
                            prefetching was not available, I had to modify the source code to include this functionality. I
                            used fourth-order interpolation technique and formulated an equation expressing the data rate
                            as a function of time. In addition to gaining knowledge on the MPEG-DASH standard, my
                            problem-solving approach became more refined and I acquired a better understanding of the
                            methodology for conducting research.

                    <h3>Bluetooth controlled car using 8051 microcontroller</h3>
                    <p>
                        Designed a Bluetooth controlled car by interfacing the HC-05 Bluetooth module with the serial port of the 8051
                        microcontroller. Used two 8051 microcontrollers, one for the front wheels to control the direction of movement and one for
                        the back wheels to control the forward thrust. The commands sent to the HC-05 module from a mobile app were relayed serially to the 8051 microcontrollers
                        which controlled the rotation of two DC motors connected to the back wheels and two servo motors connected
                        to the front wheels based on the commands received.
