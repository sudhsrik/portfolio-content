            <h2> Reliable Semantic Communication System Enabled by Knowledge Graph</h2>
            <p>
                Semantic communication is a promising technology used to overcome the challenges
                of large bandwidth and power requirements caused by the data explosion. Semantic
                representation is an important issue in semantic communication. The knowledge graph,
                powered by deep learning, can improve the accuracy of semantic representation while 
                removing semantic ambiguity. Therefore, we propose a semantic communication system
                based on the knowledge graph. Specifically, in our system, the transmitted sentences
                are converted into triplets by using the knowledge graph. Triplets can be viewed as 
                basic semantic symbols for semantic extraction and restoration and can be sorted based
                on semantic importance. Moreover, the proposed communication system adaptively adjusts 
                the transmitted contents according to channel quality and allocates more transmission 
                resources to important triplets to enhance communication reliability. Simulation results 
                show that the proposed system significantly enhances the reliability of the communication 
                in the low signal-to-noise regime compared to the traditional schemes.

            <h2> Finite block length coding for low-latency high-reliability wireless communication</h2>
            <p>
                This paper takes a step towards making practical cooperative protocols for wireless low-latency 
                high-reliability communication. We consider the effect of finite block-length error correction 
                codes and the main message is that the demands on the error-correcting code are different in 
                different phases of a diversity-seeking cooperative protocol: In the first hop where messages
                must reach potential relays, the code only has to achieve a moderate probability of error. The 
                final hop from relays to the destination is where the code must be ultrareliable. The results 
                are illustrated in the context of a simple concatenated Hamming+Reed Solomon code.
