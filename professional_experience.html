                        <p>
                            Worked on feature improvements for the SightLine product of Netscout which provides DDoS protection + visibility into network traffic.
                            Added shell commands to enhance configurability and added fixes to the implementation of RTR protocol for enabling Resource PubKey Infrastructure.
                            Modified authentication methods used by the product so as to make it FIPS/CC compliant.
                            Increased the number of configuration options available by 15% for cloud-initialisation of the product.

                        <p>
                            Automated the Design Verification (DV) process of Portmux and Pin Pad reset states using Python, reduced verification time by 90% . SHARC ADSP-based automated programming of SoCs in both assembly (for SHARC cores) and C (for ARM A55 cores) to reduce verification time. 
                            System level Design Verification (DV) of the SoC integration of MSHC (Mobile Storage Host Controller) block. Programmed various kinds of DMA transfers to and from MSHC blocks and the cache memories in the system. Partially automated the code generation process for the above task.
                            Also worked on a small percentage of EMAC tasks and programmed DMA transfers for this block as well.

                        <h3> RL for enabling URLLC over noisy feedback channels for low power short message IoT applications </h3>
                        <p>
                            Investigated the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reliability of an instantaneous feedback based variable symbol length scheme.
                            Simulated the above transmission scheme using python and applied RL to enforce a constant packet length in spite of variable symbol lengths per bit.
                            Interim results indicated that use of RL reduced the BER by upto 10X at 5dB SNR compared to using fixed length BPSK symbols.

                        <h3> Estimating Remaining Useful Life of Lithoum Ion batteries by using Digital Twins </h3>
                        <p>
                            Developed an ML based Digital Twin (DT) solution that utilizes RNNs to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Lithium ion batteries with high
                            accuracy and robustness under dynamic operating conditions. Two DTs were used: one for estimating battery capacity and the other for extrapolating it to measure RUL. 
                            Reduced capacity prediction RMSE by 55% and obtained a 95% confidence interval of Â±5 for the RUL estimate.
